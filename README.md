Democracy is not only stripping away purposeless hierarchies, it means making the world together. There had not been better time to dream a new world and build it - * *perhaps it has been always embedded in our universal consciousness* * , so right now is just the right time to materialize it together.  

What would it be our life if we had time to understand we are not trapped in a condition imposed upon us by society, but by a condition we selfimpose by evading our innate search for freedom and hapiness. Right now, more than ever, people are struggling to be alone with themselves, because we no longer know what to do when we are free from those obligations we created to mute the link of our existence and our purpose.     

This is my manifesto, which begins by salutating the new world I want to build by coding, a new world were the economic system is built on purpose, freedom and compasion for others.
